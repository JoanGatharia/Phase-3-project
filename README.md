# Phase-3-project
# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. The goal is to **identify customers at risk of leaving** and implement proactive strategies to improve retention.

The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as **account length, call usage, service plans, and customer service interactions**. Various machine learning models were tested, with **Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers** performing best after hyperparameter tuning.

## Business Understanding
### Business Problem
Customer churn negatively impacts revenue and increases acquisition costs. By predicting churn, the company can implement **data-driven retention strategies**.

### Project Objectives
1. **Predict churn using classification models** to identify high-risk customers.
2. **Determine key churn drivers** like service plans and customer service interactions.
3. **Implement data-driven retention strategies** based on model insights.
4. **Improve customer service** by analyzing the impact of service interactions on churn.
5. **Enhance loyalty and marketing strategies** through targeted offers.

### Research Questions
1. What are the most significant factors influencing customer churn?
2. Does frequent customer service interaction indicate a higher risk of churn?
3. Do customers with an international plan have a higher churn rate?
4. Can a machine learning model accurately predict churn using available features?

## Data Overview
- **Dataset Name:** `Churn_tel_data.csv`
- **Records:** 3,333 rows
- **Features:** 21 (including `account length`, `total call minutes`, `international plan`, etc.)
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converted `Churn` from boolean to integer.
   - Encoded categorical variables (`international plan`, `voice mail plan`).
   - Dropped **irrelevant columns** (e.g., `phone number`, `area code`).

2. **Outlier Detection & Handling**
   - Used **Z-score** to detect extreme values.
   - Applied **log transformation** to normalize skewed features.

3. **Feature Engineering & Selection**
   - Created new variables (e.g., `total charge` derived from `minutes`).
   - Used **correlation analysis & Chi-square tests** to remove redundant features.

4. **Handling Missing Values**
   - No missing values detected in the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Key Insights
- **High churn rates** among customers with frequent customer service calls.
- **Customers with international plans tend to churn more.**
- **Night call duration is a significant churn predictor.**
- **Churn rate varies by state but not by area code.**

## Machine Learning Models
| **Model**                 | **Accuracy** | **Recall** | **Precision** | **F1-Score** |
|---------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Logistic Regression       | 84.7%       | 5.1%       | 55.6%        | 9.3%        |
| Decision Tree (Tuned)     | 92%         | 69%        | 79%          | 74%         |
| Random Forest (Tuned)     | 93%         | 59%        | 91%          | 72%         |
| K-Nearest Neighbors       | 82.9%       | 2%         | 14.2%        | 3.5%        |

### **Best Model: Decision Tree (Tuned)**
- **Accuracy:** 92%
- **Recall:** 69%
- **Precision:** 79%
- **F1-Score:** 74%

### **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Used **GridSearchCV** to optimize:
  - `max_depth`
  - `min_samples_split`
  - `min_samples_leaf`
- Applied **Class Weighting** to handle class imbalance.

## Tableau Visualizations
Created an interactive dashboard to visualize:
**Churn Rate by State & Area Code**
**Customer Service Call Analysis**
**Churn Trends Based on Call Minutes & Charges**
**Demographic Insights on Churn Behavior**

## Conclusion & Recommendations
### Key Findings
**Customers with high service calls have increased churn risk.**
**International plan users show higher churn rates.**
**Night call duration is a significant churn predictor.**

### Business Recommendations
**Improve Customer Support:** Reduce complaints with better service.
**Targeted Retention Offers:** Provide discounts to high-risk customers.
**Optimize Service Plans:** Create flexible plans for international callers.
**Monitor Key Metrics:** Regular churn analysis for proactive decision-making.
